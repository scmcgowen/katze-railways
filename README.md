# Katze Railways
Improves railways in a few ways, currently by adding Rail Assemblers and Modular Trains.  

## Modular Trains
Modular Trains adds new cargo wagons and locomotives with equipment grids, as well as a Locomotive Power Link item that provides power to the grid while the train has fuel.

# Rail Assembler
Assembles as fast as an Assembler 3
